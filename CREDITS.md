# CREDITS
As already declared, this game is ~~a clumisily executed clone of  ~~ inspired by [Voyageur](https://brunodias.itch.io/voyageur).

The basic gameplay is quite simple; it is a good basis for experimenting with procedural content generation, starting naive, and hopefully getting better and better.


## Grammar specification
Some of the text is procedurally generated through substitution grammars.
In particular, a subset of [Tracery](https://tracery.io/) syntax is used, with a custom implementation. 
Tracery was specified and originally implemented in Javascript by Kate Compton.
